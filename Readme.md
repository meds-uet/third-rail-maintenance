# üöá Third Rail Defect Detection System (TRDDS)


A comprehensive system for detecting defects in metro third rails using both **image processing** and **real-time webcam analysis**. The system identifies:
- Corrosion/Dark spots
- Surface wear patterns
- Cracks/Linear defects
- LED glare interference

## üåü Key Features

### üì∑ Dual Operation Modes
1. **Batch Image Processing** (`TRD_training.py`)
   - Process folders of rail images
   - Generate detailed defect reports
   - Create before/after comparisons

2. **Live Webcam Analysis** (`TRD_video.py`)
   - Real-time defect detection
   - Interactive controls:
     - üìπ Record 20-second videos
     - üì∏ Capture still images
     - ‚ÜîÔ∏è Side-by-side comparison view
   - Optimized for Raspberry Pi 5

### üîç Advanced Detection Capabilities
- **Multi-stage defect classification** by type and severity
- **LED glare removal** for clearer analysis
- **Adaptive thresholds** for varying lighting conditions
- **Configurable sensitivity** through easy-to-edit macros

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV 4.5+

## üöÄ Usage

### Batch Processing Mode
1. Place your rail images in `/images` folder
2. Run:
   ```bash
   python3 TRD_training.py
   ```
3. Results saved in:
   - `/output/processed` - Annotated images
   - `/output/comparisons` - Before/after comparisons

### Live Webcam Mode
1. Connect your webcam
2. Run:
   ```bash
   python3 TRD_video.py
   ```
3. Use the interactive controls:
   - **RECORD** button: Capture 20-second video
   - **CAPTURE** button: Save still image
   - **EXIT** button: Quit application
   - *Keyboard shortcuts*: R=Record, C=Capture, Q=Quit

4. Outputs saved in:

### Batch Processing Example
| Original Image | Processed Result |

## üß© Technical Approach
1. **ROI Extraction**: Focuses analysis on the critical rail surface area
2. **LED Glare Removal**: Uses adaptive thresholding and inpainting
3. **Multi-Method Detection**:
   - Corrosion: Adaptive thresholding + contour analysis
   - Cracks: Canny edge detection + Hough line transform
   - Wear: Morphological operations + texture analysis
4. **Classification**: Defects categorized by type and severity

## üìà Performance Metrics

|---------------|-----------|------------|----------|
| Batch         | Original  | N/A        | ~3-5/img |
| Live          | 640x480   | 10-15      | 25-30    |
